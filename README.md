==============

Directories are have a ./secure subdirectory in them for any files that may contain sensitive or confidential information.  Please be sure to store those types of files under that directory, and encrypt them.  The .gitignore will ensure no .py, .txt, .rpt, and .sql (currently) in those directories will be pushed.  The encrypted version should have all project team members keys used for encryption.
